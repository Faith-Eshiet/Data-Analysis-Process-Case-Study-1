# Data-Analysis-Process-Case-Study-1
This case study is a project from the ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity.
For this case study, I investigated a dataset on chemical properties and quality ratings of wine samples by going through the entire data analysis process.
The data analysis process is organized into five steps: Question, Wrangle, Explore, Draw Conclusions, and Communicate.
The goal of this project is to walk through each of these steps to investigate a dataset on wine quality using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
